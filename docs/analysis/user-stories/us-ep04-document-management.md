# EP-04: Document Collection & Management (Recopilación y Gestión Documental)

Requesting documents from clients, receiving uploads, reviewing for acceptance, generating legal
documents from templates, and organizing everything by expediente. Covers both client-submitted
documents and firm-generated legal writings.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-4.01** — As an **associate**, I want to create a document request for a client with a
  checklist of required documents and a due date so that the client knows exactly what to submit and
  by when.

- **US-4.02** — As a **client**, I want to see a clear checklist of documents I need to submit, with
  descriptions of each one, so that I don't submit the wrong thing.

- **US-4.03** — As a **client**, I want to upload documents from my phone or computer so that I can
  submit them without emailing attachments.

- **US-4.04** — As an **associate**, I want to see which documents have been submitted and which are
  still pending for each expediente so that I know what's blocking progress.

- **US-4.05** — As a **paralegal**, I want to review a submitted document and mark it as accepted or
  rejected (with a reason) so that the client knows if they need to resubmit.

- **US-4.06** — As a **client**, I want to receive a notification when a document is rejected with
  the reason so that I can fix and resubmit quickly.

- **US-4.07** — As an **associate**, I want to receive a notification when all requested documents
  for an expediente have been submitted so that I can proceed with the work.

- **US-4.08** — As an **associate**, I want to organize documents by expediente with a clear folder
  structure so that I can find any document quickly.

## Should

- **US-4.09** — As a **paralegal**, I want to send automatic reminders to clients who have pending
  documents past the due date so that I don't have to follow up manually.

- **US-4.10** — As an **associate**, I want to generate legal documents (demanda, contestación,
  recurso, contrato) from templates pre-filled with expediente data so that I can draft efficiently.

- **US-4.11** — As an **associate**, I want to download all documents for an expediente as a ZIP
  file so that I can work with them offline or share them externally.

- **US-4.12** — As a **paralegal**, I want to define document checklist templates (e.g., "Standard
  client onboarding: DNI, poder, hoja de encargo") so that I can reuse them across expedientes.

- **US-4.13** — As an **associate**, I want to track document versions so that I can see the history
  of changes to a document.

## Could

- **US-4.14** — As an **associate**, I want to preview uploaded documents (PDF, images) in the app
  without downloading them so that quick reviews are faster.

- **US-4.15** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see firm-wide document collection metrics (avg.
  time to completion, most delayed document types) so that I can identify bottlenecks.

- **US-4.16** — As an **associate**, I want to record how each document was filed (LexNET,
  presencial, correo) and the filing date so that there is a submission audit trail.
