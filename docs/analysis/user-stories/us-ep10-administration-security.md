# EP-10: Administration & Security (Administración y Seguridad)

Firm configuration, user management, client registry, court directories, RGPD compliance, and audit
trails. The operational foundation that supports all other epics.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-10.01** — As an **office admin**, I want to register the firm's information (name, CIF,
  address, phone, email, sector) so that the system is properly configured.

- **US-10.02** — As an **office admin**, I want to create user accounts with roles (socio director,
  asociado, paralegal, admin) and set permissions so that access is appropriate to each role.

- **US-10.03** — As an **office admin**, I want to manage the client registry (add, edit,
  deactivate) with NIF/CIF, contact information, and type (individual, company) so that client data
  is centralized.

- **US-10.04** — As an **associate**, I want all my actions to be recorded in an audit trail (who,
  what, when) so that there is a complete record for compliance and dispute resolution.

- **US-10.05** — As a **managing partner**, I want role-based access control so that associates only
  see their expedientes while partners see all, and clients only see their own information.

## Should

- **US-10.06** — As an **office admin**, I want to maintain a directory of juzgados (name, type,
  jurisdiction, address, partido judicial) so that court information is centralized and accurate.

- **US-10.07** — As an **office admin**, I want to maintain a directory of procuradores (name,
  colegio, número de colegiado, contact, partidos judiciales) so that assignments are efficient.

- **US-10.08** — As a **managing partner**, I want to configure RGPD compliance settings (data
  retention periods, consent management, data processing register) so that the firm meets its legal
  obligations.

- **US-10.09** — As an **office admin**, I want to import clients from a CSV/Excel file so that I
  can migrate data from our previous system.

- **US-10.10** — As an **office admin**, I want to configure notification preferences (email
  settings, notification templates) so that communications are properly branded.

## Could

- **US-10.11** — As a **managing partner**, I want to assign client portfolios to associates so that
  each lawyer has a defined set of clients they are responsible for.

- **US-10.12** — As a **managing partner**, I want to configure the firm's areas of practice (civil,
  penal, laboral, mercantil, etc.) with default matter types so that expediente classification is
  standardized.

- **US-10.13** — As an **office admin**, I want to configure the judicial calendar (national
  holidays, August recess, autonomous community holidays) so that deadline calculations are
  accurate.

- **US-10.14** — As a **managing partner**, I want to track license usage and system health so that
  I can ensure the platform is running properly.
