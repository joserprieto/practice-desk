# EP-06: Client Portal (Portal de Clientes)

The client-facing view of the system. Minimal, focused, and designed for infrequent and
non-technical users. Provides case status visibility, document management, communication, and
invoice access.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-6.01** — As a **client**, I want to log in with a simple method (magic link or email +
  password) so that I can access my information without complex credentials.

- **US-6.02** — As a **client**, I want to see a dashboard with my active expedientes, pending
  documents, upcoming hearings, and unread messages so that I have everything at a glance.

- **US-6.03** — As a **client**, I want to see only my own expedientes and documents so that my
  information is private from other clients.

- **US-6.04** — As a **client**, I want to see the current status and procedural phase of my case(s)
  without having to call the firm so that I stay informed.

- **US-6.05** — As a **client**, I want to view and download documents that my lawyer has shared
  with me (sentencias, escritos, informes) so that I have copies of everything relevant.

## Should

- **US-6.06** — As a **client**, I want to see upcoming hearing dates and what I need to prepare so
  that I can participate effectively.

- **US-6.07** — As a **client**, I want to see a history of past expedientes (closed/archived) so
  that I can reference previous work done by the firm.

- **US-6.08** — As a **client**, I want to update my contact information (phone, email, address) so
  that the firm always has my current details.

- **US-6.09** — As a **client**, I want to view my invoices and payment status so that I know what I
  owe and what I've paid.

## Could

- **US-6.10** — As a **client**, I want to rate the service received on a closed expediente so that
  the firm can measure client satisfaction.

- **US-6.11** — As a **client**, I want to digitally sign the hoja de encargo profesional through
  the portal so that I don't need to visit the office.

- **US-6.12** — As a **client**, I want to see a breakdown of costs (honorarios, suplidos,
  provisiones de fondos) so that I understand what I'm paying for.
