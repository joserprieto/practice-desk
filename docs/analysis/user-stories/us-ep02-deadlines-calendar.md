# EP-02: Procedural Deadlines & Calendar (Plazos Procesales y Agenda)

The most critical workflow for a Spanish law firm. Missed procedural deadlines cause preclusión
(loss of the right to act), caducidad de la instancia (case abandonment), and professional liability
claims against the lawyer. Deadline calculation must account for días hábiles (working days),
weekends, holidays, and the August judicial recess (inhábil).

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-2.01** — As an **associate**, I want to register a plazo procesal with start date, duration,
  type (días hábiles or naturales), and legal consequence of missing it so that I can track all my
  obligations.

- **US-2.02** — As an **associate**, I want the system to calculate deadline dates automatically,
  excluding weekends, holidays, and the August judicial recess so that deadlines are accurate.

- **US-2.03** — As an **associate**, I want to receive escalating alerts for approaching deadlines
  (7 days, 3 days, 1 day, same day) so that I never miss a plazo procesal.

- **US-2.04** — As an **associate**, I want to see all my pending deadlines in a calendar view (day,
  week, month) so that I can plan my work.

- **US-2.05** — As an **associate**, I want to mark a deadline as completed with evidence (e.g.,
  LexNET submission receipt) so that there is a verifiable audit trail.

- **US-2.06** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see a firm-wide deadline dashboard showing all
  pending, approaching, and overdue plazos so that nothing slips through.

- **US-2.07** — As a **paralegal**, I want to track and remind lawyers of pending deadlines
  approaching their due dates so that I can support the team proactively.

- **US-2.08** — As an **associate**, I want deadlines to be automatically created when a court
  notification is received (e.g., 20 days to file contestación after emplazamiento) so that I don't
  have to calculate them manually.

## Should

- **US-2.09** — As an **associate**, I want to see the legal consequence of each deadline
  (preclusión, caducidad, prescripción) so that I can prioritize by severity.

- **US-2.10** — As a **managing partner**, I want a deadline compliance report showing met vs.
  missed deadlines per associate so that I can monitor quality.

- **US-2.11** — As an **associate**, I want to differentiate between procedural deadlines (plazos
  procesales), prescription periods (prescripción), and internal deadlines so that each gets
  appropriate urgency.

- **US-2.12** — As an **associate**, I want to delegate a deadline task to a paralegal while
  retaining responsibility so that routine tasks are handled efficiently.

## Could

- **US-2.13** — As an **associate**, I want a "calculadora de términos" that computes the exact due
  date given a start date, number of days, and type (hábiles/naturales) so that I can verify
  calculations.

- **US-2.14** — As an **associate**, I want to configure my personal alert preferences (email,
  in-app, both) for deadline notifications so that I receive them through my preferred channel.

- **US-2.15** — As a **paralegal**, I want to see a combined deadline calendar for all associates I
  support so that I can coordinate across multiple lawyers.

- **US-2.16** — As a **managing partner**, I want to receive immediate alerts for any deadline that
  becomes overdue across the firm so that I can intervene when needed.
