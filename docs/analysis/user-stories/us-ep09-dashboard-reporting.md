workload distribution, and exportable reports.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-9.01** — As a **managing partner**, I want a dashboard with: total active expedientes,
  approaching deadlines, overdue documents, today's hearings, and pending invoices so that I have an
  operational snapshot.

- **US-9.02** — As an **associate**, I want a personal dashboard with: my active expedientes,
  upcoming deadlines, pending document requests, today's appointments, and unbilled time so that I
  can plan my day.

- **US-9.03** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see workload distribution across associates
  (expedientes per associate, by status, by area of law) so that I can rebalance when needed.

## Should

- **US-9.04** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see deadline compliance metrics (% met on time,
  average margin, missed deadlines) per associate so that I can monitor quality.

  billing, and deadlines for a given period so that I can produce management reports.

  response times, resolution times) so that I can improve service quality.

  desestimado, parcialmente estimado, acuerdo) by area of law and by associate so that I can
  identify strengths.

## Could

  month, avg. resolution time over time) so that I can track firm performance.

- **US-9.09** — As a **managing partner**, I want a pipeline view of potential new expedientes
  (consultas iniciales, presupuestos enviados, hojas de encargo firmadas) so that I can forecast
  workload.

  value, collection rate, realization rate) so that I can monitor firm health.

- **US-9.11** — As an **associate**, I want to see my personal performance metrics (billable hours,
  utilization, expedientes resolved) so that I can track my own progress.

- **US-9.12** — As an **office admin**, I want to schedule automatic reports (weekly, monthly) sent
  to managing partners so that reporting is consistent.
