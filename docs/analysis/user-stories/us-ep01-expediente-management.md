# EP-01: Expediente Management (Gestión de Expedientes)

The core unit of work in a law firm. An "expediente" is the complete dossier for a client engagement
— broader than a single court proceeding, it may contain multiple procedimientos (proceedings),
actuaciones (procedural actions), and documents.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-1.01** — As an **associate**, I want to create a new expediente with reference number, area
  of law, matter type, client, and description so that I can start tracking a legal engagement.

- **US-1.02** — As an **associate**, I want to assign a procurador to an expediente so that court
  representation is coordinated from the start.

- **US-1.03** — As an **associate**, I want to register all parties (demandante, demandado,
  codemandados, terceros intervinientes) with their procedural roles so that the case file is
  complete.

- **US-1.04** — As an **associate**, I want to record the assigned court (juzgado), case number
  (número de autos), and judge so that I can track where the proceeding is being handled.

- **US-1.05** — As an **associate**, I want to see all my active expedientes with status, next
  deadline, and court so that I can prioritize my work.

- **US-1.06** — As an **associate**, I want to update an expediente's status (abierto, en trámite,
  pendiente resolución, cerrado, archivado) so that everyone knows where it stands.

- **US-1.07** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see all active expedientes across the firm,
  grouped by associate, so that I can monitor workload distribution.

- **US-1.08** — As a **managing partner**, I want to reassign an expediente from one associate to
  another so that workload stays balanced.

- **US-1.09** — As an **associate**, I want to run a conflict of interest check against all contacts
  and parties in the system when opening a new expediente so that I comply with deontological
  obligations.

- **US-1.10** — As a **paralegal**, I want to see expedientes assigned to my associate(s) so that I
  can support them proactively.

- **US-1.11** — As an **associate**, I want to classify expedientes by jurisdiction (civil, penal,
  laboral, contencioso-administrativo, mercantil) and matter subtype so that I can filter and report
  by category.

## Should

- **US-1.12** — As an **associate**, I want to link related expedientes (e.g., first instance →
  appeal → cassation) so that I can follow the full procedural chain.

- **US-1.13** — As an **associate**, I want to record the hoja de encargo profesional (engagement
  letter) with fee structure and terms so that the client relationship is properly formalized.

- **US-1.14** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see a timeline/history of all actions on an
  expediente so that I can audit what happened and when.

- **US-1.15** — As an **associate**, I want to add internal notes to an expediente that are not
  visible to the client so that I can keep a private work log.

- **US-1.16** — As an **associate**, I want to record the opposing counsel (abogado contrario) and
  their procurador so that I have their contact information readily available.

- **US-1.17** — As an **associate**, I want to search across all expedientes and documents for prior
  work on similar matters so that I can reuse strategies and precedents.

## Could

- **US-1.18** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see aggregate statistics (avg. time to
  resolution, expedientes per category, per associate) so that I can make data-driven decisions.

- **US-1.19** — As an **associate**, I want to record the cuantía (amount in dispute) so that I can
  track the financial exposure of each case.

- **US-1.20** — As a **paralegal**, I want to perform initial data entry for new expedientes and
  client onboarding (hoja de encargo, KYC documentation) so that the intake process is efficient.
