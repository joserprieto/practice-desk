# EP-07: Appointment Scheduling (Agenda de Citas)

Scheduling and managing client appointments: consultations, follow-ups, document signings. Distinct
from court hearings (EP-03) which are part of the proceeding workflow.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-7.01** — As an **associate**, I want to schedule an appointment with a client for a specific
  date, time, and type (consultation, follow-up, signing) so that both parties know when to meet.

- **US-7.02** — As a **client**, I want to receive a notification about my upcoming appointment with
  date, time, and location (office or remote) so that I don't forget.

- **US-7.03** — As an **associate**, I want to see my upcoming appointments in a calendar view so
  that I can plan my day.

- **US-7.04** — As a **paralegal**, I want to schedule appointments on behalf of an associate so
  that I can coordinate their calendar.

- **US-7.05** — As a **client**, I want to confirm or request to reschedule an appointment so that
  conflicts are handled early.

- **US-7.06** — As an **associate**, I want to receive a notification when a client requests a
  reschedule so that I can propose a new time.

## Should

- **US-7.07** — As an **associate**, I want to see my availability and avoid double-bookings so that
  scheduling conflicts don't happen.

- **US-7.08** — As a **client**, I want to receive reminders (24h, 1h before) about upcoming
  appointments so that I don't miss them.

- **US-7.09** — As a **paralegal**, I want to see a combined calendar for all associates I support
  so that I can coordinate across multiple schedules.

- **US-7.10** — As an **associate**, I want to link appointments to specific expedientes so that the
  meeting context is clear.

## Could

- **US-7.11** — As an **associate**, I want to define recurring appointments (e.g., weekly check-in
  with a long-running client) so that I don't recreate them manually.

- **US-7.12** — As an **office admin**, I want to see room/resource availability when scheduling
  in-person meetings so that we don't double-book meeting rooms.
