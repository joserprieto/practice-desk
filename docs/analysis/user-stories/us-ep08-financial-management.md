# EP-08: Financial Management (Gestión Económica)

Time tracking, billing, and invoicing for a Spanish law firm. Includes Spanish-specific financial
concepts: provisiones de fondos (advance payments), suplidos (third-party pass-through expenses not
subject to IVA), VeriFactu-compliant invoicing (mandatory by July 2026), and IRPF retention
calculations.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-8.01** — As an **associate**, I want to track my billable time with a start/stop timer linked
  to specific expedientes so that I capture all billable work accurately.

- **US-8.02** — As an **associate**, I want to manually enter time entries with date, duration,
  description, and expediente so that I can log work done without the timer.

- **US-8.03** — As a **paralegal**, I want to generate invoices (notas de honorarios) from time
  entries and expenses for a specific expediente so that billing is accurate.

- **US-8.04** — As a **managing partner**, I want invoices to comply with VeriFactu requirements
  (sequential numbering, QR code, AEAT reporting) so that the firm meets its legal obligations by
  the July 2026 deadline.

- **US-8.05** — As a **paralegal**, I want to track payments received and mark invoices as paid,
  partial, or overdue so that collection status is always current.

- **US-8.06** — As an **associate**, I want to record provisiones de fondos (advance payments)
  linked to expedientes so that client advances are properly accounted for.

- **US-8.07** — As an **associate**, I want to record suplidos (third-party expenses: tasas
  judiciales, gastos notariales, gastos registrales) separately from honorarios so that they are
  invoiced correctly (suplidos are not subject to IVA).

## Should

- **US-8.08** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see aged receivables (facturas pendientes) with
  aging buckets (30, 60, 90+ days) so that I can manage collections.

- **US-8.09** — As a **managing partner**, I want to approve invoices before they are sent to
  clients so that billing is reviewed.

- **US-8.10** — As a **managing partner**, I want profitability reports by expediente, by client,
  and by area of law so that I can evaluate which work is profitable.

- **US-8.11** — As an **associate**, I want to define the billing model for each expediente (hourly,
  fixed fee, iguala/retainer, mixed, cuota litis) so that invoicing matches the engagement terms.

- **US-8.12** — As an **associate**, I want the system to apply the correct IVA (21%) and IRPF
  retention (15% standard, 7% first 3 years) to invoices automatically so that tax calculations are
  accurate.

- **US-8.13** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see each lawyer's billable hours, utilization
  rate, and realization rate so that I can evaluate performance.

## Could

- **US-8.14** — As a **paralegal**, I want to calculate tasación de costas using the applicable
  baremo from the Colegio de Abogados so that recoverable costs are properly quantified after a
  favorable judgment.

- **US-8.15** — As a **managing partner**, I want to track turno de oficio designations and pending
  compensation from the Comunidad Autónoma so that legal aid work is properly managed.

- **US-8.16** — As an **associate**, I want to generate proforma invoices (minutas) before the final
  invoice so that clients can review before billing.

- **US-8.17** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see revenue trends (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
  by lawyer and by area of law so that I can track firm performance over time.

- **US-8.18** — As a **paralegal**, I want to send payment reminders to clients with overdue
  invoices so that collections are pursued systematically.
