# EP-05: Client Communication (Comunicación con Clientes)

Traceable messaging between firm staff and clients within the context of expedientes. Replaces
scattered email and phone calls with organized, auditable communication.

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-5.01** — As an **associate**, I want to send a message to a client within the context of an
  expediente so that communication is traceable and organized.

- **US-5.02** — As a **client**, I want to receive notifications about new messages from my lawyer
  so that I don't miss important updates.

- **US-5.03** — As a **client**, I want to reply to a message from my lawyer through the app so that
  I don't have to use email or phone.

- **US-5.04** — As an **associate**, I want to see the full message history for an expediente so
  that I have context before communicating with the client.

- **US-5.05** — As an **associate**, I want to notify a client when there is a significant case
  update (new resolution, upcoming hearing, milestone) so that clients stay informed.

## Should

- **US-5.06** — As a **paralegal**, I want to send messages to clients on behalf of an associate so
  that routine communications don't require attorney time.

- **US-5.07** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see all communications for an expediente in
  case an associate is unavailable so that client service continuity is maintained.

- **US-5.08** — As an **associate**, I want to use message templates for common communications
  (welcome, document request, case update, hearing reminder, case closed) so that I save time on
  repetitive messages.

- **US-5.09** — As an **associate**, I want to record phone calls and meetings as communication
  entries (date, duration, summary) so that all client interactions are tracked.

## Could

- **US-5.10** — As a **client**, I want to receive notifications via email AND in-app so that I
  don't miss anything regardless of how I access the system.

- **US-5.11** — As an **associate**, I want to see a communication summary per client across all
  their expedientes so that I have the full relationship picture.

- **US-5.12** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see response time metrics (time to first
  response, avg. response time) so that I can ensure client service quality.
