# EP-03: Proceedings, Hearings & Resolutions (Actuaciones, Vistas y Resoluciones)

Tracking everything that happens inside a legal proceeding: actuaciones procesales (procedural
actions like filing a demanda, receiving a sentencia), vistas (court hearings), and resoluciones
judiciales (court decisions). Each expediente may contain multiple proceedings (e.g., main case +
interim measures + appeal).

## Must (UMFP)

- **US-3.01** — As an **associate**, I want to record actuaciones procesales (demanda, contestación,
  prueba, sentencia, recurso) in chronological order on each expediente so that I have a complete
  case history.

- **US-3.02** — As an **associate**, I want to track the current procedural phase of each proceeding
  (instrucción, audiencia previa, juicio oral, sentencia, ejecución) so that I know where each case
  stands.

- **US-3.03** — As an **associate**, I want to schedule a vista (hearing) with date, time, court,
  courtroom, and type (audiencia previa, juicio oral, comparecencia) so that all parties know when
  and where.

- **US-3.04** — As an **associate**, I want to receive notifications about upcoming hearings (7
  days, 1 day, 2 hours before) so that I can prepare and attend.

- **US-3.05** — As an **associate**, I want to record the outcome of a resolución judicial
  (sentencia, auto, providencia) including whether it is firme (final) or recurrible (appealable) so
  that I can determine next steps.

- **US-3.06** — As an **associate**, I want to record when a resolution is notified and have the
  system auto-create the corresponding appeal deadline so that I don't miss the window to appeal.

- **US-3.07** — As a **paralegal**, I want to coordinate hearing logistics with the client,
  procurador, and witnesses so that everyone is prepared and present.

- **US-3.08** — As an **associate**, I want to track multiple proceedings within one expediente
  (e.g., main proceeding + interim measures + appeal) so that the full procedural picture is
  visible.

## Should

- **US-3.09** — As an **associate**, I want to prepare for hearings by accessing a checklist of
  evidence to present, witnesses to summon, and expert reports so that I don't miss anything.

- **US-3.10** — As an **associate**, I want to record the result of each hearing (celebrada,
  suspendida, aplazada) with notes so that there is a record of what happened.

- **US-3.11** — As an **associate**, I want to track the tipo de procedimiento (ordinario, verbal,
  monitorio, abreviado, etc.) so that the correct procedural rules are applied.

- **US-3.12** — As an **associate**, I want to file a recurso (appeal) and have the system create
  the corresponding new proceeding linked to the original so that the procedural chain is
  maintained.

- **US-3.13** — As a **paralegal**, I want to maintain a directory of juzgados with name,
  jurisdiction, address, partido judicial, and contact information so that court data is accurate
  and centralized.

- **US-3.14** — As an **associate**, I want to communicate with the procurador through the platform,
  sharing documents and confirming procedural steps so that coordination is traceable.

## Could

- **US-3.15** — As an **associate**, I want to see a timeline visualization of all actuaciones and
  resoluciones for a proceeding so that I can quickly understand the case progression.

- **US-3.16** — As an **associate**, I want to track execution of sentence (ejecución de sentencia)
  including embargo proceedings so that post-judgment enforcement is managed.

- **US-3.17** — As a **managing partner**, I want to see statistics on case outcomes (estimado,
  desestimado, parcialmente estimado) by area of law and by associate so that I can identify
  strengths and improvement areas.

- **US-3.18** — As an **associate**, I want to record the parties' attendance at each hearing so
  that there is a record of who appeared.
